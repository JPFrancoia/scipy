SciPy Code of Conduct
=====================


Introduction
------------

This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by the SciPy project,
including all public and private mailing lists, issue trackers, wikis, blogs,
Twitter, and any other communication channel used by our community.  The SciPy
project does not organise in-person events, however we expect events relevant
to our community to have a code of conduct similar in spirit to this one.

We expect this code of conduct to be honored by everyone who participates in
the SciPy community formally or informally, or claims any affiliation with the
project, in any project-related activities and especially when representing the
project, in any role.

This code is not exhaustive or complete. It serves to distill our common
understanding of a collaborative, shared environment and goals. We expect it to
be followed in spirit as much as in the letter, so that it can enrich all of us
and the technical community in which we participate.


Specific Guidelines
-------------------

We strive to:

1. Be open. We invite anyone to participate in our community. We preferably use
   public methods of communication for project-related messages, unless
   discussing something sensitive. This applies to messages for help or
   project-related support, too; not only is a public support request much more
   likely to result in an answer to a question, it also makes sure that any
   inadvertent mistakes made by people answering will be more easily detected
   and corrected.

2. Be empathetic, welcoming, friendly, and patient. We work together to resolve
   conflict, assume good intentions, and do our best to act in an empathetic
   fashion. We may all experience some frustration from time to time, but we do
   not allow frustration to turn into a personal attack. A community where
   people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. We should
   be respectful when dealing with other community members as well as with
   people outside our community.

3. Be collaborative. Our work will be used by other people, and in turn we will
   depend on the work of others. When we make something for the benefit of the
   project, we are willing to explain to others how it works, so that they can
   build on the work to make it even better. Any decision we make will affect
   users and colleagues, and we take those consequences seriously when making
   decisions.

3. Be inquisitive. Nobody knows everything! Asking questions early avoids many
   problems later, so questions are encouraged, though they may be directed to
   the appropriate forum. Those who are asked should be responsive and helpful,
   within the context of our shared goal of improving SciPy project code,
   documentation and other content.

4. Be careful in the words that we choose. Whether we are participating as
   professionals or volunteers, we value professionalism in all interactions,
   and take responsibility for our own speech. Be kind to others. Do not insult
   or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behaviour
   are not acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:

    - Violent threats or language directed against another person.
    - Sexist, racist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
    - Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
    - Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
    - Sharing private content, such as emails sent privately or non-publicly, or unlogged forums such as IRC channel history.
    - Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
    - Unwelcome sexual attention.
    - Excessive or unnecessary profanity.
    - Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.
    - Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour.

5. Be concise. Keep in mind that what you write once will be read by hundreds
   of persons. Writing a short email means people can understand the
   conversation as efficiently as possible. Short emails should always strive
   to be empathetic, welcoming, friendly and patient. When a long explanation
   is necessary, consider adding a summary.

6. Try to bring new ideas to a conversation so that each mail adds something
   unique to the thread, keeping in mind that the rest of the thread still
   contains the other messages with arguments that have already been made.

7. Try to stay on topic, especially in discussions that are already fairly
   large.

8. Step down considerately. Members of every project come and go. When somebody
   leaves or disengages from the project they should tell people they are
   leaving and take the proper steps to ensure that others can pick up where
   they left off. In doing so, they should remain respectful of those who
   continue to participate in the project and should not misrepresent the
   project's goals or achievements. Likewise, community members should respect
   any individual's choice to leave the project.


Diversity Statement
-------------------

The SciPy project welcomes and encourages participation by everyone. We are
committed to being a community that everyone feels good about joining. Although
we may not be able to satisfy everyone, we will always work to treat everyone
well.

No matter how you identify yourself or how others perceive you: we welcome you.
Though no list can hope to be comprehensive, we explicitly honour diversity in:
age, culture, ethnicity, genotype, gender identity or expression, language,
national origin, neurotype, phenotype, political beliefs, profession, race,
religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, subculture and technical
ability.

Though we welcome people fluent in all languages, SciPy development is
conducted in English.

Standards for behaviour in the SciPy community are detailed in the Code of
Conduct above. We expect participants in our community to meet these standards
in all their interactions and to help others to do so as well.


Reporting Guidelines
--------------------

While this code of conduct should be adhered to by participants, we recognize
that sometimes people may have a bad day, or be unaware of some of the
guidelines in this code of conduct. When that happens, you may reply to them
and point out this code of conduct. Such messages may be in public or in
private, whatever is most appropriate. However, regardless of whether the
message is public or not, it should still adhere to the relevant parts of this
code of conduct; in particular, it should not be abusive or disrespectful.

If you believe someone is violating this code of conduct, you may reply to them
and point out this code of conduct. Such messages may be in public or in
private, whatever is most appropriate. Assume good faith; it is more likely
that participants are unaware of their bad behaviour than that they
intentionally try to degrade the quality of the discussion. Should there be
difficulties in dealing with the situation, you may report your compliance
issues in confidence to either:

- The SciPy Code of Conduct Committee, at conduct@TODO (preferred)
  Members of this committee are TODO

Or alternatively to:

- Chair of the SciPy Steering Committee: Ralf Gommers
- Executive Director of NumFOCUS: Leah Silen


Incident reporting resolution & Code of Conduct enforcement
-----------------------------------------------------------

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response
that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The SciPy Code
of Conduct Committee, and the SciPy Steering Committee (if involved), are
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an
incident. 

The process for acting on any received code of conduct violation report at a
high level (for all but the most severe cases) will be:

1. acknowledge report is received
2. reasonable discussion/feedback
3. mediation (if feedback didn't help)
4. enforcement via transparent decision by the Code of Conduct Committee (if mediation failed)

The committee will respond to any report as soon as possible, and at most
within 72 hours.  More details on how reports are handled can be found in
:ref:`CoC_reporting_manual`.


Endnotes
--------

This Code defines empathy as "a vicarious participation in the emotions, ideas,
or opinions of others; the ability to imagine oneself in the condition or
predicament of another." Empathetic is the adjectival form of empathy.
